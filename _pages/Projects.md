## <span id="CCO"> Curved-creased origami mechanical metamaterial (Completed)</span>
This work presents a comprehensive framework for designing and analyzing the curved crease origami mechanical metamaterials and proposes the inverse design method that could pave the way for a range of novel applications.

* Theoretical model
  Based on the hypothesis of ruling angle, the theoretical model is deduced from mechanics and geometry.

* Validation
  The finite element method is compared with the theoretical model to verify the rationality of theoretical model.

* Experiment
  The validity of the theoretical model is further verified by experiments.

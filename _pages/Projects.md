## <span id="CCO"> Curved-creased origami mechanical metamaterial (Completed)</span>
This work presents a comprehensive framework for designing and analyzing the curved crease origami mechanical metamaterials and proposes the inverse design method that could pave the way for a range of novel applications.

The work was eventually published in IJMS: [Sun, Yucong, et al. "Curved-creased origami mechanical metamaterials with programmable stabilities and stiffnesses." International Journal of Mechanical Sciences (2023): 108729.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2023.108729)
